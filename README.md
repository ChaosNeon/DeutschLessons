# Deutsch Aid Tool
Recently I've been learning Deutsch from level zero, I'm a total beginner so I thought it could be a cool idea to program my own assisting tool to help me review topics I've seen.
In that way I can not only review topics from my Deutsch lessons, but also from my programming courses.
In it's current state, its pretty rough, and only certain modules work.
